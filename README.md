Application for extensive management of grades and other student data in a high school.

* This is an application I created in 2003 as part of my high school graduation project.

* This app is meant to be used by school administrative staff to manage various student data, 
including grades and personal information, in a user-friendly way.

* Users can create and edit student profiles, enter grades for various classes, examine and export statistics, 
automatically generate and print various documents and reports, and more. 

* The program can be used on a local network through ODBC interface, it uses activeX interface 
to communicate with external programs, and SQL for database communication.

* The application was developed in object-oriented Delphi (Pascal), and the screenshots of the main parts of the 
program are available in the PDF in the repo.
